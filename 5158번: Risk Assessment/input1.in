In these risky economic times make good
investments. Not bad ones. Microsoft is still very blue-chip stock but
AIG looks risky. Pixar is not bad up-and-coming. Could even be
slightly promising. Not very risky. Not blue-chip
though. wells-fargo is extremely bad.
Considering MICROSOFT more it is promising.
Wells-Fargo is not blue-chip in fact extremely risky. Bad. Very very bad.
