Chinua Achebe was born on November 16,
1930 into the Igbo African ethnic group
in southern Nigeria. He was raised in a
Christian family, but he was always
fascinated by the traditional African
religion and culture.

Achebe uses the short story of a
hard working man in a war torn area
with a bright outlook on life to
act as a model for other Africans
affected by the Nigerian Civil War.
